# Project

SoundClick NFT

# Description

For the Encode Harmony hackathon, we built a dApp for music creators that have been left behind with the new digital way to produce music, collaborate with others, and get paid. Our application help creators, artist, and writers to sell their music directly to their fans and send and receive tips/perks.

## What is the functionality of your solution?

Sound Click was created for you; the writer, the performer, the beat maker, the producer, the engineer, the record label, the publisher, the videographer, the artist, and the CREATOR. Sound Click was built for the person telling their story with music and to find like-minded people to experience it with. Music is the universal language that connects us across the globe. Music brings out our human emotions and music is the unified voice of the people.

An Ecosystem built to support the use and the growth of Music projects by enabling participants to actively get involved in the network via theoretical and interactive educational content provided by the active communities of established Music projects.

We provide the following functionality:

- Allows creators to create beats
- analysis report of transactions on the login page
- Allows users to provide updates about their beat’s process
- Allows users to follow their favorite artists and received personalized content
- Allows users to donate erc20 tokens
- Allows users to donate NFTs
- Allows users to browse beats and listen to them
- In the future, users will be able to send or receive tips for their cause
- Beats are represented as NFTs
- Easily collect accurate information that is available to the public using blockchain technology

What is your plan for real-world implementation?
Our plan is to release an MVP for people to try out, gather feedback and improve our app. We are planning to release a few versions, starting with the MVP with a few revisions. Then every 3 months release new functionality to our app until we have a fully functional app. We are definitely planning to deploy it to the mainnet, and partner up with nonprofits, government institutions, influencers, and artists.

How we built it

Sound Click application makes use of the following software:

- `Harmony` Network enables our application to be a scalable platform with fast transactions. We deployed our app on the Harmony Testnet Network. \*`Covalent APIs` was beneficial for users' dashboard page, transactions, and tips. This facilitated the retrieval of users’ NFTs and smart contract transactions. The Covalent API endpoints to get all NFTs balances and metadata from a wallet address such as images, contracts name, NFTs images, and balances.
- `Solidity` for the smart contract.
- `OpenZeppelin ERC721` we use the ERC721 template for faster development of our smart contract.
- `Hardhat` for local blockchain development.
- `React Js, Material-ui, Web3` React Js for the frontend, Material-UI, and Web3 to connect to the blockchain.
- `IPFS NFTStorage` for data storage on IPFS that generates a transaction hash used to create an NFT of a photo.
- `NFTPort` smooths the path of the minting and donating process and eliminates the high transaction
